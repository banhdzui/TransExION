# PyTorch implementation of TransExtION: Transformer based Explainable similarity metric for IONS 
## Introduction
TransExtION is a supervised learning method estimating ***spectral similarity*** between MS/MS spectra that are strongly correlated to their structural similarity. It can be used in spectral library search to find structural analogues. TransExtION is based on Transformer architecture and provides a ***post hoc explanation*** for its outcome in order to reveal the relationship between fragments.
